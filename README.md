# Calculator

* Exciting Milestone: I Built a Python Calculator during my CodSoft Internship!

I am thrilled to share a project I recently completed during my internship at CodSoft feature-rich calculator built using Python and PyQt6 python Gui librarie. This project not only helped me deepen my programming skills but also gave me hands-on experience with creating user-friendly applications.In This Calcultor I use python gui libraries like pyqt6 for making the calculator gui.

*Key Features:*

- *Basic Operations:* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

- *User Interface:* Intuitive and clean design making it easy to use.

I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing my journey.
